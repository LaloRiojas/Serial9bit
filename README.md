## :dart: About ##

This project is a 9-bit library with a command-line interface (CLI). It provides functionality for working with 9-bit data on DB9 Serial ports. The library is designed to Send and recienve 9 bit data over a serial port. The CLI provides a user-friendly interface for executing operations on 9-bit numbers and can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into other applications.

The library is writtten in C and is designed to be used in other projects that require 9-bit data transmission over a serial port. This is common in old serial communication protocols that use the 9th bit as a wakeup bit or for error checking etc. The library provides functions for sending and receiving 9-bit data over a serial port, as well as functions for setting up the serial port. more information can be found in the Serial.h file.

Please note that this project is intended to be used as a library, but it also includes a CLI for testing and demonstration purposes. the CLI is very much in ALPHA stage and is probably not working. no testing has been done on it
